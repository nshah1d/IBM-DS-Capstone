## Visual Analysis Findings

**1. Which site has the largest number of successful launches?**
* **Observation:** KSC LC-39A
* **Detail:** When selecting "All Sites", KSC LC-39A represents the largest slice of the success pie chart (typically around 41-42% of all successes).

**2. Which site has the highest launch success rate?**
* **Observation:** KSC LC-39A
* **Detail:** It has the highest ratio of success (1) to failure (0) in its individual pie chart (approx 76.9% success rate).

**3. Which payload range (Kg) has the highest launch success rate?**
* **Observation:** 2,000kg – 4,000kg
* **Detail:** The scatter plot shows a dense cluster of successful launches (class 1) in this mass range with very few failures.

**4. Which payload range (Kg) has the lowest launch success rate?**
* **Observation:** 5,000kg – 7,000kg (or potentially the lower <2000kg range depending on dataset version)
* **Detail:** This range shows a higher concentration of failed launches (class 0) compared to successes.

**5. Which F9 Booster version (v1.0, v1.1, FT, B4, B5, etc.) has the highest launch success rate?**
* **Observation:** FT (Falcon 9 Full Thrust)
* **Detail:** The scatter plot shows the "FT" category has a significantly higher number of green dots (success) compared to older versions like v1.0 or v1.1.
